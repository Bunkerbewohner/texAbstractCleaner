# texAbstractCleaner
short python 3 script meant to remove header information from .tex abstractions for inclusion in a workshop booklet

requires removing \documentclass{}, \begin{document}, \end{document} lines. Bonus: deleting original files, checking if the script was already run and giving a final list of authors and their corresponding .tex file. All this to allow easy inclusion of abstracts in a booklet via \include

REQUIRES python 3
